# World-Happiness-Report-DataAnalysis
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project on the 2017 World Happiness Report dataset, conducted as part of the EPFL Applied Machine Learning course (Project 1). The dataset, sourced from the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network and Gallup World Poll, includes survey data from over 160 countries and evaluates multiple factors affecting global happiness.

The goal of this project is to practice and demonstrate key data science and machine learning skills, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and statistical analysis. The project steps encompass importing and cleaning the data, descriptive statistics, region-based grouping, advanced visualizations, correlation studies, and probability calculations.

# Dataset Overview
The World Happiness Report measures happiness as a composite score derived from seven key criteria: economic performance (GDP per capita), healthy life expectancy, social support, trust in government and business, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and a dystopia residual benchmark. Additionally, data regarding job satisfaction across countries is analyzed.

# Project Tasks Summary
## Data Import and Cleaning: 
Loading the dataset, handling missing values, checking data types, and summarizing key statistics.

## Indexing and Grouping: 
Segmenting data by region, calculating mean happiness scores, ranking regions, and analyzing regional happiness score ranges.

## Visualizations: 
Creating bar charts and stacked bar charts of happiness scores for top countries and region-specific subsets; histograms of job satisfaction percentages.

## Scatter Plots & Correlation: 
Generating pairwise scatter plots to explore relationships between happiness and contributing factors, and computing correlation statistics.

## Probability Computations: 
Estimating probabilities related to region-specific happiness scores.

## Matrix Construction: 
Building an indicator matrix to map countries to their respective regions with binary values.
